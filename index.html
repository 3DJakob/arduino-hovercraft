      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>
        October the 5th me and a few friends embarked on a journey to build a
        autonomous hovercraft using an arduino, some IR sensors and some old
        quad copter components i had laying around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project turned out to be a success and the hovercraft worked well!
        It still can make some improvments but mostly I was suprised that it
        even managed to hover at all.
